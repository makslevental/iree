// Lightweight lock-free ringbuffer for uint64_t elements.
// Requires that the capacity is a power of two. Callers are responsible for
// allocating storage for the ringbuffer and must zero initialize it.
// Capacity must be a power-of-two.
//
// Note that today only the device is allowed to manipulate the ringbuffer.
// We could allow the host to share the data structure and operations but would
// need to change our atomics to be system scope instead of device scope.
//
// This implementation is derived from
//   "A Lock-Free Inter-Device Ring Buffer" by Keith Jeffery
//   https://www.keithjeffery.org/assets/files/lock_free_ring_buffer.pdf
//   https://github.com/kjeffery/lock_free_ring_buffer/tree/main
// It was ported to OpenCL C, specialized for uint64_t, and simplified as it
// only needs to run on-device and does not support locking. The paper is quite
// concise and worth a read if touching this code.
//
// The basic idea is that writers reserve space and then repeatedly try to
// acquire a write_index and populate the entry at that index. If any other
// writer comes in between when the space was reserved and the write index was
// attempted it'll be retried. In some pathological cases with multiple writers
// and fewer readers it's possible that the write_index needs to completely loop
// through the ring to find a free slot, but it is guaranteed to complete in
// O(capacity) iterations.
//
// Readers are more straightforward and reserve an entry then repeatedly try to
// acquire a read_index of an entry to take. If any other reader comes in
// between when an entry is reserved and when a particular read_index is tried
// the reader will retry. As with writers in certain pathological cases where
// there are far more readers than writers it's possible for the read_index to
// loop over the entire ringbuffer.
//
// Note that each atomic is kept on its own cache line as we expect
// multi-producer/multi-consumer behavior and want to avoid reads and writers
// from conflicting as much as possible. Probably overkill for the frequencies
// involved with our usage.
