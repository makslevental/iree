// A pool of HSA signals available for transient usage by the device runtime.
// The host allocates the signals and initializes the free list with their
// opaque handles. The signals must be allocated via the HSA
// hsa_amd_signal_create API with either HSA_AMD_SIGNAL_AMD_GPU_ONLY or
// HSA_AMD_SIGNAL_IPC today but we may partition pools for each as-needed.
//
// This is implemented as a ringbuffer initially populated with all available
// signals. Signals are acquired by dequeuing them from the ringbuffer and
// released by enqueuing them. There are probably easier ways of doing this but
// the ringbuffer is useful for ordering other work as well and is known to work
// well with multiple producers and consumers that may be concurrently acquiring
// and releasing signals on device.
//
// The signal pool is only used by the device and can be allocated in
// local memory without host visibility. Signals in the pool may be used on the
// host and need to be standard HSA signals.
